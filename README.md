## Weapons

### Revolvers
- [Fan Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT91uk5Mbqg): shoots powerful shots, which you charge up by shooting enemies with any revolver. Coins have a unique behaviour.

- [Malevolent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry_1gfVrn-E): three rapid shots, and a diet malicious railcannon. Explosions pierce on the alt.

### Shotguns
- [Demolitionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PuebUdcj88): shoots parriable sticky bombs on alt fire.

### Nailguns
- [Airblast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6MtnhCHWw): charge up a blast of air that reflects projectiles, launches enemies, and you. The alt releases a huge shockwave.

### Railcannons
- [Virtuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHnhYhKlSLs): creates a virtue beam on every enemy hit. Creates a smaller one when it hits the ground.

### Rocket Launchers
- [S.L.F. Striker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazqWG20eVg): alt fire releases a powerful homing rocket, which needs to be charged up by hitting enemies with RLs.

### Arms

## Installation

If using [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/Waff1e/WafflesWeapons), you can install it using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). 

Otherwise, download the .zip, and extract it to `ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\plugins`

## Dev Setup

Currently, if you want to edit the Unity project, you need to edit and run the setup .bat file, to create a Magenta symlink.

You can't do this if you don't have Tundra, I'll fix that later.
